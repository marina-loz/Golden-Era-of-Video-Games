# Golden Era of Video Games

## Project Overview

Is the golden age of video games behind us, or are we living in it now? According to Mordor Intelligence, the global gaming market is expected to exceed $300 billion by 2027. With such high stakes, publishers are continuously investing in creating the next blockbuster title. But are video games actually improving in quality?

In this project, I analyze critic scores, user ratings, and global sales for the top 400 video games released since 1977. The goal is to identify when the golden era of video games occurred and examine how user reception and critical reviews align with commercial success.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Release year (1977 and onward)
- Critic and user scores
- Global sales figures (in millions)
- Game metadata such as platform, genre, and publisher

## Analysis Objectives

- Identify years with the highest average critic and user scores
- Compare critic scores with user ratings to detect trends and discrepancies
- Analyze sales performance over time and by genre/platform
- Highlight top-rated and best-selling games by decade

## Sample Findings

Based on average critic and user ratings from 1977 onward, several standout years can be considered part of the "golden era" of video games:

- **1998** had one of the highest combined ratings, with an average critic score of **9.32** and a user score of **9.4** across 10 top games.
- **2004** and **2008** also performed strongly, showing high critic and user alignment.
- **1997** stood out with the **highest user score** (9.5), although critics rated it lower on average.
- The years **2009â€“2010** continued to show high user appreciation, though critic scores slightly declined.

These insights suggest that the late 1990s to late 2000s may represent a golden period in terms of critical and public acclaim for video games.
